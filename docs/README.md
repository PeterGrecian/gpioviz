# Hardware Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the hardware used with the GPIO Visualizer.

## Screw Terminal HAT

The GPIO visualizer is designed to work with a screw terminal HAT that has:
- 4 rows of terminals and LEDs
- 40-pin GPIO header layout
- LED indicators showing pin states:
  - 3.3V pins: Pink LEDs
  - 5V pins: Red LEDs
  - ID_SD/ID_SC pins: Turquoise/dim LEDs
  - GPIO pins: Green when HIGH, dark when LOW

## Layout Modes

- **Hat Mode**: 4 columns × 10 pins arranged to match the physical HAT layout
- **Header Mode**: 2 columns × 20 pins showing the traditional GPIO header arrangement

Add photos or diagrams of your HAT hardware to this folder for reference.
